geo-model
=========

Geoprocessing workflow capability for Web Processing Services. Built on jsPlumb 1.3.4+ http://jsplumb.org/jquery/draggableConnectorsDemo.html
and OpenLayers 2.12+ http://openlayers.org/dev/examples/wps.html.

The geo-model builds the respective OpenLayers WPSExecute.js based upon the model's input. The model's workflow determines the WPS 'subprocess' chaining capabilities.
